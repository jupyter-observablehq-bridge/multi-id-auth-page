# JOB Multi ID Provider Auth Page

See [documentation](TBD).

## Definition

A demo instance of a **JOB Auth** web page (JOBA) is available at https://jupyter-observablehq-bridge.github.io/multi-id-auth-page.

It allows a user to authenticate with a number of ID providers:

- [Google single signin](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in)
- SG Connect (corporate example)

To add/remove other ID providers simply clone the repo and publish your own JOBA.

Most main stream ID providers offer off-the-shelf JavaScript libraries that encapsulate the complexity of the OAuth 2.0 mechanism (redirection, refresh, etc), are typically imported via top level `<script>` tags, and then simple to use.

Consequently a JOBA can be a simple aggregate of several ID providers user friendly authentication libraries.  
To make that even simpler the demo JOBA is written in [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) for structure but does **not** require a build step.  
So it is easy to fork and adapt.
